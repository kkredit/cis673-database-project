# CIS 673 Project

This repo contains code for the GVSU CIS 673 course project. CIS 673 is
Intro to Database Design, and this project is a simple database implemented
using Oracle's SQLplus DBMS.

# Concept

The database stores information to help cleaning services customers and
providers connect to one another. Customers create orders consisting of
particular cleaning tasks, and providers bid on those orders. The customer
chooses a winning bid, and the business connection is made.
